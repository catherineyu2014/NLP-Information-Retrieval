Instructions for running the program:
	python cjy6445_HW4.py

Program details:
- this program takes in a query, namely, 'cran.qry', and compares its content with an abstract, namely, 'cran.all.1400'. 
- for each query, the program calculates a cosine similarity score against each abstract.
- then, the program outputs the results in 'output.txt', where for each query, abstracts are printed in descending order based on cosine similarity scores.
